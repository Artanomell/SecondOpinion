## Bugs and feature request

The preferred way to report bugs and feature request is to use the
[GitHub issue tracker](http://github.com/thsmi/SecondOpinion/issues).

But you can also send an email to schmid-thomas at gmx.net

In order to process bugs faster consider the following:

* Try if the [most recent nightly build](https://github.com/thsmi/SecondOpinion/blob/master/nightly/README.md) fixes your issue.
 
* Check if you issue is already reported. The list with open issues is small. 
  Try to avoid to duplicate an issue. It slows down the development.

* Include information about your system and server. This means which 
  the operating System you are on. Which Thunderbird release you are using.

* Include a debug log/trace with your issue. Go to the addons settings and set the debug level to 3. Be sure to scramble any personal information.

* Mention very precisely what went wrong. "X is broken" is not a good bug
  report. What did you expect to happen? What happened instead? If possible 
  describe the exact steps how to reproduce the issue.
